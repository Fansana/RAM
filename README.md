A javascript project that emulates a RAM (Random Access Machine) as defined in ram.pdf
This software is provided as is and you may use it at your own risk.

This project resulted out of personal interest for the inner workings of a RAM, there might be some errors here and there as I haven't had the time and motivation to test everything.

The only reason I uploaded this is so I can manage the source from different machines.
